				<p class="more title">Rokt Platform Design</p>
				<p class="uppercase topp">Overview</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Rokt began a redesign of its entire B2B application with the vision of
					becoming the next biggest ads management platform, alongside Facebook
					Ads Manager and Google Ads
				</p>
				<p class="uppercase topp">Goal</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					The goal of this particular project was to identify any usability
					issues with the beta release and determine the critical features to
					prioritise for the next iteration of the product.
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Rokt is a Sydney-based internet marketing company that connects
					businesses to their customers through the customer buying experience.
				</p>
				<p class="uppercase topp">Process</p>
				<img src="" alt="" />
				<p class="more title">Understanding the problem</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Before Rokt even hired a product design team, a beta release of the
					new platform had been implemented based on blue-sky concepts executed
					by an external consultancy. These mockups were created without any
					usability testing and had little consideration for the technical and
					product limitations on the scope of work.<br />
					I conducted research interviews with our primary users (account
					managers) to uncover any pain points that they were experiencing with
					the beta release. ‍ <br />My research encompassed:<br />
					-Understanding the user goals and needs<br />
					-Uncovering pain points with the existing user journey<br />
					-Determining the success of the tasks measured
				</p>
				<p class="more title topp margin-bottom">Gathering insights</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium margin-bottom">
					After collecting the recordings from the user interviews, I conducted
					affinity mapping with my teammate to synthesise the pains identified.
					We grouped these problems under common themes and features in the
					platform.
				</p>
				<img src="images/rokt-1.png" alt="image-here" class="topp port-image" />
				<p class="line-height-medium topp margin-none">
					I relied on a data-driven approach known as the severity framework to
					inform my process and list usability issues in order of priority. The
					framework helps to identify the severity score of a usability issue
					based on the following three variables:
				</p>
				<p class="more text-center font-size-md line-height-tall">
					<span>Task criticality x impact x frequency = severity</span>
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium margin-bottom">
					<span class="more">Task criticality</span> - how important is the task
					to the user? (1 = low, 5 = critical)<br /><span class="more"
						>Impact</span
					>
					- how much of an impact does this issue have on the user's task? (1 =
					suggestion, 5 = blocker)<br />
					<span class="more">Frequency (%)</span> - how many times does this
					come up out of total participants?
				</p>

				/>
				<p class="more title topp margin-bottom">Prioritisation of issues</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					I took the extra step of categorising these problems into broader
					Epics to provide the Product managers and engineers with visibility
					into the key areas of the platform that needed to be addressed from a
					usability standpoint. This not only helped to prioritise usability
					issues in order of need but also helped to shape the product roadmap
					for the quarter. ‍
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Product, Design and Engineering teams came to the conclusion that the
					first Epic we would prioritise would be the Audience Wizard due to its
					severity score, UX and engineering effort required to rebuild it.
				</p>
				<img src="images/rokt-3.png" alt="img-3" class="topp port-image" />
				<p class="more title topp margin-bottom">
					Narrowing down the scope of work
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Based on the user interviews conducted with 7 users on the existing
					Audience wizard, we found the following key issues: -57% of users felt
					that the process of configuring the wizard was arduous -29% were
					frustrated that the Next button was disabled so they could not
					identify which were missing required fields -29% of users found that
					it was easy to miss field inputs due to a lack of visual hierarchy
				</p>
				<img src="images/rokt-4.png" alt="img-4" class="port-image" />
				<p class="more title topp margin-bottom">Wireframing the Solution</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Based on the above problems identified, I worked towards addressing
					these pains by coming up with potential solutions:
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					-Reducing the number of steps to minimise time to completion <br />
					-Surfacing mandatory fields and enabling the Next button to show error
					validation <br />-Establishing clearer visual form hierarchy by
					grouping related fields <br />-The lack of a formal wizard component
					also meant that I had to come up with a standardised styling and UI
					pattern for future wizards
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium margin-bottom">
					I quickly mocked up some basic wireframes to gather feedback from
					Product, Engineering and the users on the overall layout and structure
					of the wizard form. This involved establishing a standardised visual
					hierarchy and layout for the future wizard component. ‍

				<p class="more title topp margin-bottom">Validating the designs</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					I conducted usability testing sessions with our primary users to
					validate whether the new designs would solve their problems. I wrote a
					script including a scenario asking the user to create a new Audience
					targeting females of all ages on mobile devices with manual bidding
					enabled.
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					During the session, I observed how they interacted with the prototype
					and set up the Audience. The usability session revealed that it was
					less arduous to set up a new Audience due to the grouping of related
					fields. It was easier for the user to identify which forms they had to
					fill, as advanced settings were now hidden under a collapsable toggle.
