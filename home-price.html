					Home Prices are Growing Crazily
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Housing and rental prices have always been subject to the whims of the
					market, fluctuating over time, rising and falling based on supply and
					demand. Many companies have spent untold dollars monitoring and
					logging this data to give researchers and comment people the ability
					to view the current market within the context of data spanning decades
					to establish trends and compare results.
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Our project and final visualization explores the historical housing
					and rental market fluctuations over the last 20 years across the
					United States. The goal was to visually represent how different areas
					in our country have grown or diminished, and give the user the ability
					to manipulate that data through filters, such as property type and
					features.
				</p>
				<p class="uppercase topp">Process</p>
				<img src="images/process.svg" alt="process image" class="process-image" />
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					When we started this project, we elected to use the basic
					User-Centered Design process of Discover, Define, Design, Deliver.
					This process allowed us to research and explore our chosen space and
					better understand what our users needed and the best options for
					delivering a solution. As we moved forward we were able to iterate on
					our design and validate the direction of our project. Overall, this
					process was a great means to ensuring that our project delivered a
					solid solution.

				<p class="uppercase topp">User research</p>
				<p class="more title margin-none margin-bottom">
					What are Home Buyers Looking for
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					To get greater insight into our users, we sent a survey to more than
					60 people to get an understanding of what people who own a home - or
					are looking for a home - would find interesting as they explore a
					visualization. This data validated our initial hypothesis that users
					were interested in viewing historical housing trends by year and
					property type, as well as understanding how a neighborhood and city
					has changed over the last 20 years.
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					<span class="more">Findings 1 </span>: Home price and location are the
					most important factors when users consider renting/ buying a house.
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					<span class="more">Findings 2 </span>: Most users would like to
					explore the home price trend by neighborhood and years, as well as
					house size and type.
				</p>
				<p class="uppercase topp">Data Profile</p>
				<p class="title more margin-none margin-bottom">
					Expansive Zillow Dataset
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					The housing price data we used came from two indices with Zillow
					Research: the Zillow Home Value Index for house prices, and the Zillow
					Rent Index for rentals. Both of these datasets are intended to list
					average home and rental prices for all homes in an area, not just
					those currently listed. The Zillow data covered the entire United
					States and was separated in multiple levels of geographic area,
					including state, metro area, city, zip code, and neighborhood. While
					this data may have been more expansive than we required, having the
					flexibility could prove valuable. The data was also broken down by
					type of home: single-family vs. condo vs. multi-family, as well as the
					size of home (1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, etc.).

				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Once we better understood our idea and explored our datasets, we began
					additional ideation for our vision. We quickly settled on the basic
					components and layout of our visualization through several quick
					rounds of sketches. We explored interactions around our map and how we
					could display states, metro areas, and cities that would allow users
					to click on different geographic areas and display the home value and
					rental price data. We also reviewed patterns that expressed different
					ways users could filter the data and modify the map and associated
					information.

					Simplification Needed. Less is More.
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					With a more cohesive visualization and interaction set, we created an
					initial prototype in Tableau and conducted a usability study to
					validate our initial findings and gather additional feedback from our
					users. For our study, we used a working prototype of our visualization
					that was created within Tableau and displayed as a dashboard for users
					to navigate. At the start of each session, we asked two introductory
					questions about the visualization, followed by asking them to complete
					three tasks, which entailed interacting with the map and filtering the
					data. After completing all three tasks, we asked the participants five
					follow-up questions regarding their overall impressions.

				<p class="uppercase topp">Findings and Suggestions</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Our usability study showed that our participants had an overall
					positive first impression of the visualization, despite functional
					issues related to a low-fidelity prototype. Our primary takeaway from
					this experience was the need for simplification. Our original goal was
					to provide an in-depth experience whereby users could examine data in
					a specific area and then view historical trends. As our ambitions
					grew, so too did the complexity of the visualization. <br />In
					addition, our users had a great deal of feedback around the map. Users
					had preconceived notions of how the map should navigate and we were
					often compared to more mature mapping options, such as Google Maps or
					Zillow Map Search. After this study, we felt the best solution would
					be to limit selection options just states, which also decreases the
					potential for users to become lost in the map due to excessive zooming
					or panning.
				</p>
				<p class="uppercase">Iterations</p>
				<p class="more">Three Major Improvements</p>
				<p class="title more margin-bottom">Limit the Scope</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					As a result of our study, we limited the scope of our visualization
					and implemented several minor enhancements. This included limiting the
					map to only allow users to select states, removing the ability to
					transition the map to view counties and cities. We also made cosmetic
					changes to the map, including removing all the other countries using
					Tableau’s “opacity” parameter, and making Alaska and Hawaii separate
					maps off to the side in order to zoom in on the contiguous 48 states.
				</p>
				<p class="title more margin-bottom">Get Connected</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Another important change was to correct minor issues linking the map
					to the line chart using dashboard actions in Tableau. With the new
					experience, when a user hovers over a state on the map, that state’s
					data is highlighted on the line chart; when a user selects a group of
					states, the line chart filters to show only those states.
				</p>
				<p class="title more margin-bottom">Simplified the Filters</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					We also reduced the number of filters on the “State map and time
					series” dashboard allowing users to filter by date range, home size
					(number of bedrooms), home type, and index type (home value, rent, or
					rent per square foot). When users explore those filters their changes
					will apply to both the map and the line chart.
				</p>
				<p class="uppercase topp">Final Product</p>
				<p class="title more margin-bottom margin-none">Interactive Home Price Visualization</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					Based on our explorations and study, we felt very confident in our
					direction going into the development of our final visualization, which
					I am limited to sharing because the NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS.
				</p>
				<p class="title more margin-bottom">What we did well</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					As a group we feel that we were successful in developing and
					implementing a visualization that allows user to view and explore
					housing and rental prices across the United States. We provided an
					overview, filtering methods, and details on demand, and we
					appropriately used hue to encode nominal data and value for
					quantitative data. We avoided chart junk and provided clear legends,
					titles, and disclaimers.
				</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					While the scope of the project changed from the start of our project,
					the final visualization adheres to our original vision, incorporating
					many of the features we desired. While we were unable to add the
					granularity in the map we desired, our testing identified this as a
					cartographic limitation in Tableau, so we understand that users would
					not have gotten the benefit of zooming in to view counties and cities
					as we had intended. Since this was uncovered during user testing, we
					feel that our process was able to define that issue and give us enough
					time to address it properly, which would label this change a success.
				</p>
				<p class="title more margin-bottom">What could be done differently</p>
				<p class="line-height-medium">
					An area where we feel we were not entirely successful was alerting
					users that they had the ability to compare two areas on our map. While
					the functionality is available through the use of the Control key to
					select multiple states or by brushing over a group of states, we
					believe that this could be more straightforward with the addition of a
					short message or notification to the user. Additional exploration was
					deprioritized due to time constraints. As a future study topic, this
					could be a quick and easy include that users could find very
					interesting.
